# Car Speed Detection - speed-camera.py

![example-result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/622065/89743556-15265680-da59-11ea-83b0-77ba488b5be0.gif)

_This is a 25mph zone!_

## Description

This program, designed for the Raspberry Pi, records the speed of cars driving perpendicular to a PiCamera.  For vehicles traveling faster than a specified speed, it will send the video feed via Telegram.  It determines speed based on the field-of-view of the camera and distance from the cars.

All of the data is output in a CSV format that works well in software like Splunk.

## Requirements

* Raspberry Pi 2 Model B (or 3)
* Picamera
* Opencv
* Imagemagik
* Python 3

## Example

### Installation

_One week worth of data from my house. I live 100ft from an intersection, my road leads to a highway on-ramp (increase in RTL traffic), and its a 25mph zone._

## Configuration

There are a number of different sections in the `config.yaml`

### Monitoring Location

| *field* | *default* | *description* |
| ------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `upper_left_x` | `0` | top left X-value of the image monitoring area |
| `upper_left_y` | `0` | top left Y-value of the image monitoring area |
| `lower_right_x` | `1024` | bottom right X-value of the image monitoring area |
| `lower_right_y` | `576` | bottom right Y-value of the image monitoring area |
| `l2r_distance` | `65` | distance (in ft) from camera to car traveling left to right |
| `r2l_distance` | `80` | distance (in ft) from camera to car traveling right to left |

### Camera Settings

For this section, I recommend reviewing reviewing the [Hardware - Sensor Modes](https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/fov.html#sensor-modes) section of the PiCamera docs.  The default specified here works well with a PiCamera v2.

| *field* | *default* | *description* |
| ------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `fov` | `62.2` | field of view for this camera model |
| `fps` | `30` | desired FPS (not actually) |
| `image_width` | `1024` | width of image |
| `image_height` | `576` | height of image |
| `image_min_area` | `500` | minimum determined area that _could_ be a car |

### Thresholds

For this section, speed is the mean MPH, area is pixels, and confidence is how close the standard deviation of recorded MPH is from the mean.

| *field* | *default* | *description* |
| ------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `min_speed` | `10` | minimum speed to record to the logs |
| `min_speed_alert` | `30` | minimum speed to send an alert |
| `min_area` | `2000` | minimum area to record to the logs |
| `min_confidence` | `70` | minimum confidence to record to the logs |
| `min_confidence_alert` | `90` | minimum confidence to send an alert |
| `min_distance` | `0.4` | minimum seconds between events |

### Communication

| *field* | *default* | *description* |
| ------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `telegram_token` | `None` | bot token to authenticate with Telegram |
| `telegram_chat_id` | `None` | person/group `chat_id` to send the alert to |
| `telegram_frequency` | `6` | hours between periodic text updates |

### Unit system

| *field* | *default* | *description* |
| ------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `units` | `metric` | unit system to use: `metric`or `us` |


## Installation

1. Copy all files to the Pi under `/home/pi/speed-camera`
2. Install dependencies `$ sudo make install`
3. Create a config file at `config.yaml` (see *Configuration*)
4. Start the service `$ sudo make restart`
5. Tail the logs `$ make tail`

## Usage

### Preview

Preview mode writes a `preview.jpg` file out on disk as well as sending to Telegram.  This is useful for determining the `(X,Y)` coordinates you want to monitor.

```

### Normal

During normal operation, the service will write all logs to `logs/service.log`, metrics to `logs/recorded_speed.csv`, and any "alerts" to `logs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-SPEEDkph-CONFIDENCE.json` and `logs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-SPEEDkph-CONFIDENCE.gif`.

### Calibration

Sometimes your distance isn't _just_ right.  So if you record an event and you know the actual speed, you can use the calibration tool to calculate the right distance.

```
$ python3 calibrate.py logs/2020-07-30_16:52:13.285767-21mph-99.json --mph=36
2020-07-30 19:07:33,141 Frame  0: 0.13sec 79.00px 21mph == 75.98 distance
2020-07-30 19:07:33,141 Frame  1: 0.27sec 156.00px 21mph == 76.64 distance
2020-07-30 19:07:33,141 Frame  2: 0.41sec 238.00px 21mph == 77.98 distance
2020-07-30 19:07:33,141 Frame  3: 0.57sec 338.00px 22mph == 75.23 distance
2020-07-30 19:07:33,141 Frame  4: 0.70sec 416.00px 21mph == 75.40 distance
2020-07-30 19:07:33,141 Frame  5: 0.83sec 494.00px 21mph == 75.59 distance
2020-07-30 19:07:33,141 Frame  6: 0.97sec 573.00px 21mph == 75.65 distance
2020-07-30 19:07:33,141 Frame  7: 1.10sec 654.00px 21mph == 75.36 distance
2020-07-30 19:07:33,141 Frame  8: 1.23sec 731.00px 21mph == 75.61 distance
2020-07-30 19:07:33,141 Frame  9: 1.37sec 813.00px 21mph == 75.64 distance
2020-07-30 19:07:33,141 Frame 10: 1.50sec 863.00px 21mph == 77.88 distance
2020-07-30 19:07:33,141 Updated distance for RTL: 76.09
```

In this example, the car was recorded at 21 kph but it actually was going 36 MPH.  The output says to adjust the RTL distance to 76ft.
